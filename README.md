# py_misc
Miscellaneous Python scripts that I have written for streamlining purposes.

Do read the comments in the files to better understand what each script does. 

I have cited all the resources I have utilized for writing these scripts. Incase there are any concerns, feel free to contact me.

## Scripts:

1. *sending_email.py*: Allows you to automate sending emails (via Gmail). 
2. *running_dofile.py*: Allows you to run Stata do-files using Python.
